Worked on this project with my team which are a group of experienced data analysis experts for this challenge. We analysed the election procedures in anambra state during
the last presdential elections held in Nigeria.
# DATA CLEANING
We imported the data into the excel environment and used excel power query to do some cleaning. In the process of cleaning the data we checked for duplicates,missing values or mis-labels
the right data types and removed the unnecessry missing spaces.
# EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
We performed some EDA on the dataset such as using measures to find the right population of the people in Anambra state,
The total number of persons that were captured for voting
The sum total of eligible voters
The actual votes that were counted
The Number of political parties in the various wards, *e.t.c*
# DATA MODELLING
